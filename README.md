# RockbusterStealthProject
## Project Overview:
This project involves analyzing historical data for Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a movie rental company transitioning to an online video streaming service to compete with platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime. As a data analyst, my role was to assist the business intelligence team by loading the company’s data into a relational database and performing analysis to support Rockbuster's strategy for the online service launch.

##Objectives:
The primary goal was to answer key business questions posed by Rockbuster's management board to inform their company strategy. These questions included:
•	Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
•	What is the average rental duration for all movies?
•	Which countries have the most Rockbuster customers?
•	Where are high-value customers located?
•	Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

##Approach:
1.	Data Preparation:
o	The project began by loading the Rockbuster data into a PostgreSQL database. This included data on movie rentals, customers, payments, and inventory.
2.	SQL Analysis:
o	Using SQL, I performed multiple data queries to explore the dataset and answer the business questions. Key queries focused on customer distribution, revenue contribution, and regional sales patterns.
3.	Data Visualization:
o	To present the results clearly, I created visualizations of the data to help management make data-driven decisions. These visualizations included revenue trends, geographical customer insights, and other key metrics.
4.	Deliverables:
o	The final deliverables includs SQL queries, Tableau visualizations, and insights that were presented to the management team in an easy-to-consume format.
